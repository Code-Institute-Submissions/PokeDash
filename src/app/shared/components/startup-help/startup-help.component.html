	<p><b>What Are Pokémon's?</b><br />Pokémon's are creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or alongside humans. For
		the most part, Pokémon's do not speak except to utter their names. Pokémon's are raised and commanded by their owners (called
		"Trainers"). During their adventures, Pokémon's grow and become more experienced and even, on occasion, evolve into a stronger
		Pokémon. There are currently more than 700 creatures that inhabit the Pokémon universe.</p>
	<p class="d-inline">Example of this is Jigglypuff this Pokémon is a "Normal/Fairy" type and it evolves from Igglybuff when
		levelled up with high friendship and evolves into Wigglytuff when exposed to a Moon Stone.</p>
